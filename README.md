Hello! My name is Teni and welcome to my portfolio. I am an electrical engineering student at the University of Victoria. I have an interest in embedded systems, AI and robotics. 
Post-graduation, I hope to apply the knowledge and skills that I have built up to the design of sustainable and accessible technologies.

<!-- ### James Dyson Award 2022 Entry
The challenge for this year's James Dyson Award was simple: **design something that solves a problem**.
I found that the most difficult part of providing a solution to this challenge was finding something outside the box that had not laready been done. This is as a result of how fast the world is starting to depend on technology and there are many solutions for various problems already.
